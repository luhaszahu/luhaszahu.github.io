Topic- Sports Report ( All Blacks vs Ireland ) ( 42-19 ) 	

The Allblack won against Ireland on the 3rd of July at Eden park, Auckland, in the first game of the Steinlager series. It was a revenge game from what happened last year in Dublin. 

It was great determination from both sides with Ireland early on making metres from finding the holes in the All blacks defence, but it was the superior ability of the All blacks that contributed to the final margin. Ireland tried 8 times to get the ball over the try line but the All Blacks played magnificent defence to hold them off.

In the 20th minute the first try was scored from the All Blacks with Jordie Barret getting a pinpoint pass by Aaron Smith to put them on the board. Not long after Sevu Reece scored a try from a lazy dropped ball from the Irish which then led to a 75m try from Sevu Reece. The again not long after that in the 35th minute mark Quinn Tupaea followed a marvellous chip through by Beauden Barret to go in between the posts.

At the half it was 28-5 to the All Blacks with both teams scoring a lot of penalties which are 3 points from kickin it between the posts. In the 70th minute Pita Gus Sowakula did a magnificent try from the 20 metre mark off of the back of the scrum to score between the posts.

The clock struck 80 minutes and the game was over. It was a magnificent performance for the All blacks ending at 42-19 to the ABs. They played really well and gelled well as a team, it was a great way to start the series but unfortunately they ended up losing to Ireland 2 times in a row, but nonetheless they had a good first game.
