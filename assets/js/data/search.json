It’s a mid-engined hybrid built car with the help of formula 1 technology. It is powered by a 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8 engine that can produce over 7200rpm (revolutions per minute). The Valhalla has been made too easy to drive, with space for luggage behind the seats, a centre console and a phone mount for the driver.It can also be switched into an electric-only mode which can go up to 130 km/h with zero carbon emissions. Its top speed is 350 km/h and can do 0 to 100km/h in just 2.5 seconds with over 900 horsepower and more than 700 pounds of torque. The Valhalla weighs in at a light 1500kgs due to an abundance of carbon fibre monocoque in the chassis and body panels.The new Valhalla is set to enter the market in 2023. The starting price is an estimated $1,800,000 AUD or approximately $2,000,000 NZD, but this price shouldn’t discourage you if you are considering it.As previously mentioned, the Aston Martin Valhalla is made with the help of formula 1 technology, more specifically the Red Bull Racing Power-train division. This design uses KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) which charges the battery when braking or when the car is stationary.The British-based car manufacturer, Aston Martin will be releasing the Valhalla in their new line of luxury hypercars, alongside the Valkyrie, Vantage, Speedster and Vanquish." }, { "title": "All Blacks vs Ireland", "url": "/posts/test-1-Copy/", "categories": "Report", "tags": "Rugby, All Blacks, Ireland, Sports", "date": "2021-12-10 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "All Blacks vs Ireland- Te Koha GordonAll Blacks vs Ireland ( 42-19 )The Allblack won against Ireland on the 3rd of July at Eden park, Auckland, in the first game of the Steinlager series. It was a revenge game from what happened last year in Dublin.It was great determination from both sides with Ireland early on making metres from finding the holes in the All blacks defence, but it was the superior ability of the All blacks that contributed to the final margin. Ireland tried 8 times to get the ball over the try line but the All Blacks played magnificent defence to hold them off.In the 20th minute the first try was scored from the All Blacks with Jordie Barret getting a pinpoint pass by Aaron Smith to put them on the board. Not long after Sevu Reece scored a try from a lazy dropped ball from the Irish which then led to a 75m try from Sevu Reece. The again not long after that in the 35th minute mark Quinn Tupaea followed a marvellous chip through by Beauden Barret to go in between the posts.At the half it was 28-5 to the All Blacks with both teams scoring a lot of penalties which are 3 points from kickin it between the posts. In the 70th minute Pita Gus Sowakula did a magnificent try from the 20 metre mark off of the back of the scrum to score between the posts.The clock struck 80 minutes and the game was over. It was a magnificent performance for the All blacks ending at 42-19 to the ABs. They played really well and gelled well as a team, it was a great way to start the series but unfortunately they ended up losing to Ireland 2 times in a row, but nonetheless they had a good first game." }, { "title": "Protein Powder", "url": "/posts/test-1-Copy-(4)/", "categories": "Information", "tags": "Protein", "date": "2021-12-10 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Creatine and Protein powderIt is not crack.

What’s happening to the Amazon rainforest? These are questions you may be pondering in your mind. As you witness on social media the terrorising situations that so many people and species alike are experiencing due to the selfish and cruel actions of some major brands, trying to make some extra dough.Imagine this: “You’re reading your child a bedtime story and your son asks you what a chimpanzee is, you sadly reply and say, it’s a type of ape that used to roam the earth but not anymore” This is the future that we are heading towards. Not only will we have no chimpanzees, but we will also lose many other species. Blue whales, orangutans, Bluefin tuna, red pandas and tigers are currently endangered. So if we don’t deal with this now, all these animals and more will be extinct. Over the decade from 2010 to 2020 the global annual forest loss was estimated by the UN FAO to be 10 million hectares. To put that into perspective that’s over 800,000 Wellington Colleges, of forest loss. If we lose all our forests our global terrestrial biodiversity will be greatly reduced, with 80% of our global terrestrial biodiversity located in forests. Another key point was sustainable livelihoods. There are 1.6 billion people whose livelihoods are supported by healthy forests, with one billion of them among the world’s poorest. Not only does deforestation largely affect our biodiversity, but it also affects many human lives.Now after hearing that, you may be wondering, why is deforestation so bad? And what is causing it? Well, I’m about to tell you. According to LiveScience, there are many different causes of deforestation. These are things such as making room for construction, manufacturing, harvesting timber for fuel, farming and livestock. This is concerning because over 30% of the world is covered in forests but if these causes continue, that number will drop rapidly. But of these deforestation causes, the main driver of deforestation is agriculture. As said earlier there are many different drivers of deforestation but agriculture is the culprit for over 80% of the global forest loss. This is due to converting forests into different commodities including beef, palm oil, soy, cocoa, rubber, coffee, timber and many more.Forestation is like the law, it seems irrelevant and pointless but without it, the consequences would be drastic. Greenpeace wrote an article about solutions to deforestation and they mainly focused on corporate action. As quoted from the article “If corporations have the ability to destroy the world’s forests, they also have the power to help save them”. To sum this quote up, a majority of deforestation is caused by big corporations. So if we can get alternative methods for these corporations to use, then the deforestation rate will decrease rapidly. To prove this is a major solution some huge international companies that have already changed their sourcing policies are businesses like Nestle and McDonald’s. But Biofriendly planet (a website that discusses solutions to environmental problems) discussed some ways that you personally can make a difference during everyday life. The difference between having a thriving forest life and a barren wasteland is completely up to you. Some of these solutions include Simple things like recycling more, using eco-friendly products, eating sustainable foods and conserving energy and water.Deforestation shouldn’t just be something that we worry about, it’s something we can change for the better every day." }, { "title": "Death Penalty", "url": "/posts/test-1-Copy-(2)/", "categories": "Articles", "tags": "Death Penalty, Prison", "date": "2001-09-11 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "In this article, I will be jumping off the edge of a cliff and diving head first into the thrilling yet chilling topic of the death penalty. First off, what is the death penalty? Well, the death penalty is a criminal offence punishable by death - it is a very serious, yet uniquely interesting topic.As I have explained this is a punishment of the highest living order. However, this may come as a surprise to the number of countries with this law still in place. This question varies depending on the country, as some countries have a much stricter policy than others. However, in this circumstance, I shall talk about the United States and its policy on the death penalty. Yes, I am very aware that not all parts of America accept the death penalty as a law. However, based on the states that have the death penalty implemented and in good use the main factor to be considered for the death penalty would be if you have murdered someone with the full intention and in a very harsh manner. However, in most cases, it would take a murder spree for it to be seriously considered in your case. In the past, the death penalty was widely used in rape especially if it was a black defendant with white victims. Now it is a very rare occurrence that you get charged with the death penalty even if you rape multiple people.In 2019 world population review stated that 93 countries still have the death penalty in place. I thought that the death penalty was rare but after seeing these stats I have changed my mind! This is very interesting as this shows that most of the world has stopped and finished using the death penalty and has moved past it while these 93 countries insist on still having it. Out of all the countries still, with the death penalties intact, no country has committed more deaths forced by the law than China. According to the BBC, China carried out over 1000 executions in 2019. However, they do cover up a lot more so many people believe that they commit a lot more than they say. These are all the released deaths it is highly likely China covered their tracks on certain deaths but to that as of right now is just a strong conspiracy.So how long does it take till you actually get executed on death row? If you don’t know what death row is pretty much where the convicted have been charged as guilty and have been enforced the death penalty, go as they wait for their time to come. I found a very interesting fact on how long they have to wait for the average wait on death row to execution is usually 16 years. By then they might’ve already died from other inmates or natural causes. However, if there are no appeals then the process could be as quick as 6 months. This for me was insane as waiting for that long just to get executed is pretty amazing. Most die of natural causes before they have been sentenced to the room where their life will end.To conclude, the death penalty is a very serious punishment for crime. There are many people who have been convicted of being guilty for a crime but eventually prove to be innocent. This is a big problem and in my opinion, they need to change the judicial system for the better. I personally believe that the death penalty should only be used on the rare occasions where a highly severe crime has been committed. To conclude, I hope I haven’t killed your interest in this topic." } ]
